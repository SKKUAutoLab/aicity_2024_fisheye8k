    """ORB feature embedder.
    
    Args:
        num_features: The maximum number of features to retain.
        scale_factor: Pyramid decimation ratio, greater than 1. scaleFactor==2
            means the classical pyramid, where each next level has 4x fewer
            pixels than the previous, but such a big scale factor will degrade
            the feature matching scores dramatically. But, a too close to 1
            scale factor will mean that to cover a certain scale range, you will
            need more pyramid levels and so the speed will suffer.
        num_levels: The number of pyramid levels. The smallest level will have
            a linear size equal to the input_image_linear_size /pow(scaleFactor,
            nlevels - firstLevel).
        edge_threshold: This is the size of the border where the features are
            not detected. It should roughly match the patchSize parameter.
        first_level: The level of pyramid to put source image to. Previous
            layers are filled with upscale source image.
        wta_k: The number of points that produce each element of the oriented
            BRIEF descriptor.
        score_type: The default HARRIS_SCORE means that the Harris algorithm is
            used to rank features (the score is written to KeyPoint::score and
            is used to retain best :param:`num_features` features); FAST_SCORE
            is an alternative value of the parameter that produces slightly less
            stable keypoints, but it is a little faster to compute.
        patch_size: The size of the patch used by the oriented BRIEF descriptor.
            Of course, on smaller pyramid layers, the perceived image area
            covered by a feature will be larger.
        fast_threshold: The fast threshold.
